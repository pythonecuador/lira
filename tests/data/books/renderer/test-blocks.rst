Test blocks are a great way to make interactive tutorials!

Python

This is a Python test block:

.. test-block:: Write a comment
   :validator: lira.validators.Validator
   :language: python

   # Put your comment below

Plain text
----------

This is just plain text:

.. test-block:: Who is Guido?
   :validator: lira.validators.Validator

   He's the creator of something...
